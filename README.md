__PRINTEMPS__ is a C++ metaheuristics modeler/solver library for general integer optimization problems. PRINTEMPS emphasizes on the following aspects:
- __Portability.__ It is implemented as a header-only library which does not depend on any other proprietary or open-source libraries. Users can integrate it in to their own codes by just copying necessary files. 

- __Intuitiveness in modeling.__ It provides an intuitive modeling environment to define a optimization model as a program code. Users can define constraint and objective functions using arithmetic operations on decision variables.

- __Flexibility to define neighborhood.__ It automatically detects the neighborhood structure of the problem. In addition to this, PRINTEMPS also accepts user-defined neighborhood.
